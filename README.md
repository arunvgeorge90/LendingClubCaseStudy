<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Loan Amount provided is in higher range for the higher interest rate and the charged off is also high (Rec: Providing the appropriate Interest rate would avoid the charged Off)
- Low Annual Income and High Interest rate has also lead to Charged Off (Rec: Providing low interest rate to the person with low income can decrease the “charged off”)
- Less Loan Amount is provided when Annual Income is low. Loan status is Charged Off when high Loan Amount is provided for Low Annual Income
- Charged Off is high when the Interest Rate is provided in higher range for the person with Low Annual income. (Rec : Low Interest to Low incomed person can avoid the “Charged Off”)
